## WebR

This document demonstrates the [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) package for the #rstats community. Using it, in conjunction with the [quarto-webr](https://quarto-webr.thecoatlessprofessor.com/) Quarto extension, allows users to create Quarto documents with code that runs at runtime instead of during document rendering. 

```{webr-r}
p <- mtcars |> 
   ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) + 
   geom_point(shape = 21)

p
```

We can modify this base graph (stored as the variable `p`), for instance by changing the background from grey to white. 
```{webr-r}
p + theme_minimal()
```

Now, replace the text in the previous cell to read: 

```{r}
#| eval: false

p + 
  labs(title = "Title", x = "Weight", y = "Miles-per-gallon") +
  theme_minimal()
```

(You can click the clipboard icon at the upper-right of the cell above to copy its text) and click `Run Code` again.
