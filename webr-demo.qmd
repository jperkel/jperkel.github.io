## WebR

This document demonstrates the [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) package for the #rstats community. Using it, in conjunction with the [quarto-webr](https://quarto-webr.thecoatlessprofessor.com/) Quarto extension, allows users to create Quarto documents with code that runs at runtime instead of during document rendering. 

```{webr-r}
p <- mtcars |> 
   ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) + 
   geom_point(shape = 21)

p
```

We can modify this base graph (stored as the variable `p`), for instance by changing the background from grey to white. 
```{webr-r}
p + theme_minimal()
```

Now, replace the text in the previous cell to read: 

```{r}
#| eval: false

p + 
  labs(title = "Title", x = "Weight", y = "Miles-per-gallon") +
  theme_minimal()
```

(You can click the clipboard icon at the upper-right of the cell above to copy its text) and click `Run Code` again.

## Graph of a line

Here we'll graph the line, `y = mx + b`. Adjust the values of `b` and `m` below and click `Run Code`.

```{webr}
b <- 0 # y-intercept
m <- 1 # slope
print(paste0("Slope = ", m, "; y-intercept = ", b, "."))
```

Now, click `Run Code` here to graph the line. 

```{webr}
my_line <- function(x) { (m * x) + b }
p <- ggplot(data.frame(x = c(1, 50)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = my_line) + 
  theme_minimal()
p
```
